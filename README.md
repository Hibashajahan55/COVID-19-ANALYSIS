# COVID-19-ANALYSIS
# INTRODUCTION
COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, leading to a global pandemic. It spreads primarily through respiratory droplets and can cause symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness, fever, and in some cases, death. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Countries implemented strict measures such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, and social distancing to curb its spread.

# OVERVIEW
The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, spread rapidly across the globe, affecting all WHO regions and nearly every country.The analysis of the dataset from January to July 2020 reveals several key trends and patterns in the pandemic's progression:
• Europe and the Americas experienced the earliest and highest surge in cases.
• The overall Death rate was 3.72%
• The overall Recovery rate was 62.95%
• Regions and countries were affected differently, with developed nations experiencing higher case counts but also achieving better recovery rates compared to less-developed regions.
• The United Statesffeads in total cases (over 5 million) and deaths (approximately 162,804), with significant recovery figures (around 2.57 million).
• Active cases in the U.S. stand at approximately 2.29 million, and serious or critical cases are reported at 18,296.
• Active cases are incresed onwards March

#CONCLUSION
COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of global cooperation, robust healthcare systems, and rapid medical innovation. While vaccines have helped in reducing severe cases and deaths, new variants continue to pose a challenge. The pandemic underscored the need for future preparedness against global health crises and the value of public health measures in mitigating their effects.
